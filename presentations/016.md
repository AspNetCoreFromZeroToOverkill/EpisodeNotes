## The authentication service

- Standalone application

    - Centralizes authentication logic

    - Multiple applications - like web, mobile and desktop - can simply delegate authentication to it *

- OpenID Connect + OAuth 2.0 provider
    
    - Upon successful authentication, a token will be provided for the client applications to make API calls

.footnote[\* not that we're going to use it, but it's good to know we could]

## Tools/technologies we'll use

- ASP.NET Core Identity

- Razor Pages

- Entity Framework Core

- PostgreSQL

- IdentityServer4 *

## Main implementation options

1. **The easiest way** - create new application with Identity pre-configured

2. **Another easy way** - create empty application and scaffold the Identity bits

3. **A little more work** - build it ourselves, but using Identity

4. **A lot more work** - build it from scratch (and more prone to errors)

Most of the times, maybe option 2 is the way to go, but as we're exploring and learning, I'll go with 3, creating another application with the scaffolded Identity code to use as guidance.
