		## Authentication with Identity and Razor Pages
		ASP.NET Core: From 0 to overkill
	</section>
	<section data-markdown>
		## The authentication service
		- Standalone application
		- Centralizes authentication logic
		- Multiple applications - like web, mobile and desktop - can simply delegate authentication to it
			- We're not going to use it, but it's good to know we could
		- OpenID Connect plus OAuth 2.0 provider
		- Upon successful authentication, a token will be provided for the client applications to make API calls
	</section>

		## Tools/technologies we'll use
		- ASP.NET Core Identity
		- Razor Pages
		- Entity Framework Core
		- PostgreSQL
		- IdentityServer4 (next episodes)
	</section>

		## Main implementation options
		1. **The easiest way** - create new application with Identity pre-configured		
		2. **Another easy way** - create empty application and scaffold the Identity bits		
		3. **A little more work** - build it ourselves, but using Identity		
		4. **A lot more work** - build it from scratch (and more prone to errors)		
		Most of the times, maybe option 2 is the way to go, but as we're exploring and learning, I'll go with 3, creating another application with the scaffolded Identity code to use as guidance.
