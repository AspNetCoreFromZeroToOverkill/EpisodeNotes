# ASP.NET Core: From 0 to overkill - episode notes in presentation format

Putting up some notes in presentation format to assist in the videos, trying to better explain what we'll be doing in each one.

Using remark ([https://github.com/gnab/remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark)) to build the presentation.

To serve assets locally and use in the videos, using dotnet-serve ([https://github.com/natemcmaster/dotnet-serve](https://github.com/natemcmaster/dotnet-serve)).
